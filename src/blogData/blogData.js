        shortBlogOne: "JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible." ,
        blogInfoOne: "Arrays An ordered list of values that can store any amount of data in a single variable. Functions Objects that contain a sequence of statements to perform a task or calculate a value. Every function has an input, code, and an output. Variables Used to store and manipulate data in a program. They are declared using the (var) keyword, followed by a unique identifier and an optional value. For example, the code (var age = 25) creates a variable named (age) with a value of 25. Callback functions Used in timers, user interaction events, loading data from a server, and in Node.js. Promises Used to simplify the process of dealing with asynchronous operations. Promises provide a standardized way of handling the completion of asynchronous operations, making it easier to write and maintain asynchronous code. Some other basic concepts in JavaScript include: Array methods, Arrow functions, Fetch API, and Async/Await."

        title: "JavaScript Data Types, Error Handler, Function, ES6",
        shortBlogThree: "JavaScript features diverse data types (e.g., strings, numbers, objects), allowing for dynamic variable assignments. Error handling is crucial, with `try...catch` blocks catching runtime errors. Functions, key in JavaScript, encapsulate reusable code. ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced modern syntax and features like arrow functions, `let/const` variables, and template literals, enhancing JavaScript's capabilities." ,

        blogInfoThree: "*JavaScript Data Types: JavaScript data types define the kind of values that can be stored and manipulated within a program. The primary data types include primitive types such as Number (for numeric values), String (for textual data), Boolean (for true/false values), Undefined (for variables that haven't been assigned a value), Null (for intentionally empty values), and Symbol (for unique identifiers). Additionally, there’s the Object type, which is a complex data type used to store collections of data and more complex entities. Understanding these types is crucial for managing variables and performing operations in JavaScript effectively.*Error Handler: Error handling in JavaScript is a mechanism for managing errors and exceptions that may occur during code execution. The primary method of handling errors is the try...catch block, where code that might throw an error is placed inside the try block, and any resulting error is caught and handled in the catch block. There's also the finally block, which executes after try and catch, regardless of whether an error occurred. Proper error handling ensures that programs can manage unexpected conditions gracefully, without crashing, and can provide meaningful feedback to users or developers. *Function: A function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code designed to perform a particular task or calculation. Functions are fundamental building blocks of JavaScript programs. They can take inputs, called parameters, and return outputs. Functions can be declared using the function keyword or as function expressions. With the advent of ES6, arrow functions (() => {}) were introduced as a more concise way to write functions. Functions promote code reusability, modularity, and abstraction in programming. *ES6: ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard, which defines the scripting language JavaScript. ES6 introduced a host of new features and syntax improvements that greatly enhanced JavaScript's capabilities and developer productivity. Key features include let and const for block-scoped variable declarations, arrow functions for more concise function expressions, template literals for easier string interpolation, destructuring for extracting values from arrays and objects, and promises for better handling of asynchronous operations. ES6 is a significant update that modernized JavaScript and made it more powerful and easier to use."
